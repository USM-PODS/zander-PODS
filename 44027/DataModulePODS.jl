If we can agree on one abbreviation that doesn't conflict and is used often, it is fine, we just need to keep track.

    formatFileToDataFrame is a function which will turn a given CSV or Text file into a DataFrame with the default header names, and
    then returns that DataFrame.
    NOTE: only works with a correctly formatted file, all columns must be in the correct order, and there must be one header line. 
    This is how the complete files that Zander's code produces will be formatted

    PARAMETERS:
    filePath: A string that is the file path to the CSV or text file. 

    RETURNS: m  the file given.

    into one column of DateTime objects. 

    PARAMETERS:
    df: This is the DataFrame object that will be reformatted
